## INFI-X-UI (UNDER DEV)

Discord bot built with TypeScript that allows users to manage the X-UI dashboard directly from Discord. It integrates with the X-UI API to provide features such as listing users, managing subscriptions, and monitoring server status. The bot uses slash commands for easy interaction and ensures secure API communication. Ideal for admins who want to control X-UI without logging into the dashboard! ðŸš€
